ChangeLog - R package tmplate

Author: Mario A. Martinez Araya

2021-07-07 - Version 0.0.3

* Translation of R code now performed using R package tRnslate.

2020-02-01 - Version 0.0.2

* Change way how variables or arguments are entered in template function. Now it allows also to enter either either each varible appearing in the template one by one as before or entering a list containing all variables. The latter is useful to avoid hitting the limit of arguments in a function when templates have many variables.
* R chunks started by default by @r or @R. However, they needed to start just at the beginning of line (^@r or ^@R). Now there can be empty space before them (^[[:blank:]]*@r or ^[[:blank:]]*@R) which is useful for indented templates.

2019-11-29 - fix

* Fix to replace_r_code so that lines of chunks of R code without output
can be deleted in the translated template.
* Fix to long R code chunks translation. Now they can be separated with
empty spaces, so that each chunk produces different output.
* Now assignation and output chunk need to be separated by empty line.
* Vignette updated to reflect these changes.

2019-11-21 - Version 0.0.1

* Logic for template creation including inline R code.
* Translate templates to any type of file.
* Translate inline R code.
